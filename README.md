## Overview

- This is an AI chat UI focused on simplicity
- The goal is to have a nimble, highly efficient AI chat UI, with only the most used features, in the most practical way, so that it can be maintained and upgraded with minimal effort.
- It should use only the most necessary packages to be as secure as possible.

For now it uses:

- React NextJS - core framework
- Plain css modules - the project is small, therefore easily maintainable in css modules and uses some modern syntax like `popovertarget` which is troublesome in other implementations
- Zustand - simple persisted global store
- Vercel's ai-sdk - Elegant abstraction over multiple AI providers. Actively and heavily maintained.
- Markdown previewer - Easy preview the code generated by the AI for the user
- jsdom + mozilla readability - fetch website content and extracting main content.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
